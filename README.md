# BADIPagesCreatedLinks

The BADI Pages Created Links extension for Mediawiki ([Mediawiki page](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BADI_Pages_Created_Links))
allows display of links in one's Mediawiki toolbox area which lead to
other wiki or wiki-like sites
whereby links will be colored differently depending on whether the page there
has been created yet or not. The status of whether it was created yet or not
is determined by Last-Modified or HTTP 200 HTTP HEAD requests.

It would be great to see track-backs for wikis too, whereby blogs and forum
content could be displayed inside wikis if this hasn't been devised yet
already (maybe a future goal?), but this extension allows one to specify
a predefined set of specific sites to which to link.

(If open forum software like phpbb.com will allow users to create any level
of nested subforums (currently only the admins can do this I believe), we
could also allow one to link to a specific discussion forum according to
whether the forum of the same name had been started yet.)

# Usage

To use this extension, simply put the BADIPagesCreatedLinks folder containing
our extension code inside your wiki's /extensions folder and include this
line in your LocalSettings.php:

```php
    require_once($IP.'/extensions/BADIPagesCreatedLinks/BADIPagesCreatedLinks.php');
```

After this line, you can then optionally use any of the $wgBADIConfig
configuration properties inside of LocalSettings.php (do not edit the extension
files as full configuration should be possible inside LocalSettings.php alone,
also potentially allowing you to update to any future version of our extension
with a minimum of hassle).

# Configuration

The following three properties are the most likely you will wish to modify (unless you only
wish to link your pages to Wikipedia).

Each of these properties is an array keyed to a language code (if you wish to
provide language-specific link information) or to the word "default" which in
turn lead to an array of values, respectively:

1. ***titles***: site title
2. ***sites***: a template for the base URL for when the page has already been
    created. {{LANGUAGE}}, if present, will be replaced by the current
    language code.
3. ***sites_editing***: a template for the base URL for when the page has not yet
    been created and will be edited. {{LANGUAGE}}, if present, will be
    replaced by the current language code.

"default" can be used in place of a language to indicate the default values
and patterns.

For example, the following allows us to link to Wikipedia and Bahaikipedia
while allowing a different pattern for English, since "en." is not used
in the URL:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['titles']['default'] = array('Wikipedia', 'Bahaikipedia');
$wgBADIConfig['sites']['default'] = array('http://{{LANGUAGE}}.wikipedia.org/wiki/', 'http://{{LANGUAGE}}.bahaikipedia.org/');
$wgBADIConfig['sites_editing']['default'] = array('http://{{LANGUAGE}}.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=', 'http://{{LANGUAGE}}.bahaikipedia.org/index.php?title=');

$wgBADIConfig['titles']['en'] = array('Wikipedia', 'Bahaikipedia');
$wgBADIConfig['sites']['en'] = array('http://{{LANGUAGE}}.wikipedia.org/wiki/', 'http://bahaikipedia.org/');
$wgBADIConfig['sites_editing']['en'] = array('http://{{LANGUAGE}}.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=', 'http://bahaikipedia.org/index.php?title=');
```

An item in a "sites" language array can be set to NULL if a link should not be
generated for that particular language.

Although it is not necessary to change the default values, this extension
also allows you to configure the  structure for the markup that will be
produced.

The template for configuring the entire block that will be added
as a whole is "external_sites_templates:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['external_sites_templates'] = <<<HERE
    <li>{{LOCALIZED_INTRO}}
        <ul>
            {{LINK_ITEMS}}
        </ul>
    </li>
HERE;
```

It allows two variables, the first being "{{LOCALIZED_INTRO}}" which is
merely the introductory text for the links and "{{LINK_ITEMS}}" which are
the individual line items containing the links.

Each individual line item also has a temploate, "external_site_templates":

```php
    $wgBADIConfig['external_site_templates'] =
        '<li><a class="{{CLASS}}" {{STYLES}} href="{{LOCALIZED_LINK}}">{{LOCALIZED_TITLE}}</a></li>'."\n";
```

The template variable "{{CLASS}}" will be determined according to whether
the page has been created yet or not. (The default values will either be
"external" or "new"--see below.)

The template variable "{{STYLES}}" can allow inline styling information for
convenient styling of individual links, also sensitive to whether the page
has been created yet or not.

These can be added via:

```php
    $wgBADIConfig['createdLinkInlineStyles'] = ''; // e.g., font-weight:bold;
    $wgBADIConfig['uncreatedLinkInlineStyles'] = ''; // e.g., 'font-style:italic';
```

Note, however, that the {{CLASS}} variable is really a better choice
as it allows control from an external stylesheet and can take advantage
of the already-familiar styling differences within Mediawiki
as far as external (which we interpret here as already-created) links or
new ones (styled the same as though they were internal links, by default in
orange color).

The name of the classes that will be created (for created or as-yet-uncreated
pages) can also be configured, though one may wish to just use the default
classes (not necessary to specify them if using the default), since these use
the already familiar Mediawiki styling:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['createdLinkClass'] = 'external';
$wgBADIConfig['uncreatedLinkClass'] = 'new';
```

It is also possible, though probably not necessary for most people, to
configure the link  structure for both already-created links and new links.
If there is interest, we could change the code to make these differ by
language and/or site.

The variable {{SITE}} will be replaced by the base URL for an already created
external page, while {{CURRENT_PAGE_TITLE}} will be replaced by the current
wiki page's title:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['site_and_title_templates'] = '{{SITE}}{{CURRENT_PAGE_TITLE}}';
```

Similarly for links to entirely new (yet to be created) pages, {{SITE_EDITING}}
will be replaced byt he base URL for such a page, while {{CURRENT_PAGE_TITLE}}
will be replaced by the current wiki page's title:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['site_editing_templates'] = '{{SITE_EDITING}}{{CURRENT_PAGE_TITLE}}&action=edit';
```

If you don't want links to appear while the user is in other namespaces, you can set this setting:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['no_namespaces'] = true;
```

Finally, configuration has been added to allow caching. Caching is on by default, so to disable, add the following:

```php
$wgBADIConfig['no_cache'] = true;
```

One may wish to enable caching but only under certain circumstances. One can configure
caching depending on whether a corresponding page exists at other sites or not.

The following can change the default behavior to indicate that non-existent pages should not be
cached (i.e., checks should be ongoing to see whether the page has been created).

```php
$wgBADIConfig['cache_nonexisting'] = false;
```

The following can change the default behavior to indicate that pages found to exist will not be cached.

```php
$wgBADIConfig['cache_existing'] = false;
```

Finally, the caching of pages found to exist or not exist are given separate timeouts. The
following list the default settings, with the existing page timeout larger since it may
be of less concern (if not likelihood) that an existing page was deleted as opposed to
a page coming into existence.

```php
$wgBADIConfig['cache_existing_timeout'] = 31104000; // a year (12 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60)
$wgBADIConfig['cache_nonexisting_timeout'] = 2592000; // a month (30 * 24 * 60 * 60)
```

As evident above, most of the configuration will be provided by the user, but our extension does support default values if one only wishes to link to Wikipedia. This information as well as extension credits could be translated inside BADIPagesCreatedLinks.i18n.php (feel free to let us know if you write any localizations and we may include them).

Warmest regards!

# Dedication

This extension is dedicated to our Baha'i friends in Iran who, without
responding in kind, but on the contrary, who persevere in demonstrating their
loyalty and services to their communities and country, despite the
government-sponsored persecution so insidiously leagued against them
(including a denial of education itself! not to mention jobs, pensions,
and businesses and other abuses or harrassment, even of poor school children).
No doubt Iran as a whole will return to its prior glories as soon as it
stops its patently false propaganda, trumped up charges and imprisonments,
and becomes concerned with elevating the status of all of its citizens,
whether women, ethnic minorities, or Baha'is (the largest independent
religious minority in the country). Civilized countries do not come anywhere
close to doing things like denying education to its own citizens, citizens
who are moreover loyal to its authority! Is there any excuse for such
backwards behavior? Iran no doubt has yet greater contributions to
make to civilization, if it will only be truly enabled to do so.
